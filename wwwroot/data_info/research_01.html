        <li>Output of the research method(s) (data &amp; analysis) will inform ‘designs’ (+ solution/project evaluations)</li>
        <li>Research findings need to be valid &amp; reliable (else, what’s the point?)</li>
		<li>‘Formal’ research methods tend to be well-established </li>
		<li>Documented extensively – all journal articles will describe the research method(s) used.</li>

          <li>Do working part time has an effect on University students’ learning performance?</li>
          <li>What are the effects of domain knowledge on learning performance when using Learning system A and when using learning system B?</li>
          </ul>

    </div>
	<div class="content-header">Quantitative approach:</div>
	<div class="content-paragraph"><ul>
           <li>Things which involve counting, measuring, producing, in particular, aims to test hypotheses and identify differences between groups in a study are referred to as quantitative research.</li>
           <li>If you are focussing on cause and effect, for example, your research question is about:&quot; what is the effect of using unleaded petrol on air pollution issues?”, then quantitative method is useful.</li>

<div class="content-header">Qualitative approach:</div>
	
	<div class="content-paragraph">     
      <ul>
        <li>Qualitative approach concern with non-numerical data</li>
        <li>When researchers want to collect data on opinions, beliefs, behaviour, experiences, more information on an area which is new or with limited research, then qualitative approach is a must.</li>
        <li>For example, your research question is about:&quot; what is your attitudes towards the teaching and learning materials at LIBT, then qualitative method is useful.</li>
       </ul>

     <div class="content-header">Questionnaire:</div>
 <div class="content-paragraph">
 
        
          <ul>
          <li>A self-completed survey used for  large sample</li>
          <li>Types of Questions :          <ul>
          <li>Closed questions</li>
          <li>Open questions  </li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>When to use Questionnaires?
		  <ul>
          <li>To obtain data from a large number of respondents/entities</li>
          <li>To obtain uncomplicated and standardised data</li>
          <li>To obtain data from respondents who have no trouble understanding the question domain (in other words, they possess high levels of domain knowledge)</li>
		  <li>Where costs of printing, posting etc. are relatively easily recovered</li>
          </ul>
		  </li>
          <li>What are Closed Questions?
          <ul>
	      <li>Yes or No - Do you use a microcomputer at home?</li>
	      <li>One true answer - How long have you worked in the firm?</li>
		  <li>Likert Scale - Computers are a means for changing organisations. Strongly disagree   1     2     3     4     5  Strongly agree</li>
		  </ul>		  
		  
		  </li>

          <li>What are Open Questions?
		   <ul>
	      <li>“Can you please, tell me, what is the purpose of your PC at home?”</li>
	      <li>“What is your opinion of searching for  business information on the Web?”</li>
		  <li>As you can see in the above questions, the interviewee would need to give more details and explanations compared to the closed questions.</li>
		  </ul>
		  
		  </li>
         
          </ul>
    </div>
<div class="content-header">When is the right time to choose Open or Closed questions?</div>
 <div class="content-paragraph">
 
        
          <ul>
          <li>Use closed questions when you want to classify respondents  into categories.</li>
          <li>Use open questions when the respondent’s knowledge of an  area is unknown.</li>
          <li>If the researcher’s knowledge of the field is limited, use open questions. Open questions can provide more details.</li>
      <li>So in general:<ul>
      <li>Open questionnaire – Qualitative approach</li>
      <li>Closed questionnaire – Quantitative approach</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
   		  <div class="content-header">Interviews</div>
<div class="content-paragraph">        <ul>
        <li>The research method(s) you choose will depend on:<ul>
        <li>Can work as a structured conversation</li>
        <li>To provide in-depth information</li>
        <li>Can be used as part of a qualitative  evaluation</li>
        <li>May only need a relatively small sample of respondents</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Types of Interviews:       <ul>	
        <li>Structured Interview - Questions are closed. The order of the questions and their response/s are decided in advance. In other words, they are categorised in advance. Structured interviews should only be carried out in situations where you wish to draw conclusions about the whole group of respondents.</li>
        <li>Semi-structured Interview - A list of questions is prepared, but need not be asked in strict order, or with exactly the words prepared. Semi-structured interviewing is useful in situations where broad issues may be understood, but the range of respondents’ reactions to these issues is not known or suspected to be incomplete.</li>
        <li>Unstructured Interview - Questions are open-ended and freely cover a wide range of topics. Unstructured interview is more conversational. Interviewers can adjust questions according to how the interviewee is responding.</li>
      </ul></li>
        <li>Interview Tips:<ul>	
        <li>To arrange for recording facilities or other materials to be available </li>
        <li>To relate to the research questions in your study</li>
        <li>To familiarise yourself with basic terminology in the domain beforehand </li>
        <li>Not to ask long or complex questions </li>
        <li>To think of different ways of asking  the same information</li>
       </ul></li>	
      </ul>
</div>
   <div class="content-header">Observation:</div>
<div class="content-paragraph">        <ul>
        <li>A type of qualitative method to record the characteristics or behaviours of participants. Observation usually takes place in a person’s natural surroundings. Observation can be used to find out about culture from the “inside”.</li>
       </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>Observation can be both quantitative and qualitative:        <ul>
        <li>In terms of quantitative, you may want to observe on the number of occasions you make mistakes. For example during a driving test.</li>
        <li>In terms of qualitative, the researcher  may want to observe how you interact with the portal to perform your learning. Typically, he wants to capture, in depth, a deep understanding about your interaction behaviour.</li>
        </ul></li>
       <li>Advantages of Observations:
       <ul>
       <li>To discover what actually happens </li>
       <li>Not to rely on a subject’s willingness</li>
       <li>Usually small scale, but detailed research</li>
       </ul></li>

        <li>Disadvantages of Observations:<ul>	
        <li>Can be time consuming</li>
        <li>Could be bias, are you seeing only what you “want to see”?</li>
        <li>	How do you know you have a representative sample?</li>
        </ul></li>

    <li>Structured Observation:<ul>	
    <li>The researcher determines at the outset precisely what behaviours are to be observed and typically uses a standardised checklist to record the frequency with which those behaviours are observed over a specified time period.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Unstructured Observation: <ul>	
    <li>The researcher uses direct observation to record behaviours as they occur, with no preconceived ideas of what will be seen; there is no predetermined plan about what will be observed.</li>
       </ul></li>
    <li>Focus groups:<ul>	
    <li>These are a sort of ‘group interview’. Typically 5-12 focus group members &amp; 1 moderator. Discussion directed  by moderator (moves discussion forward &amp; provides ‘prompts’). These can provide a lot of data but extreme views may be more prominent and data may be difficult to interpret.</li>
       </ul></li>
   
    </ul></div>
    <div class="content-header">Experiments:</div>
   <div class="content-paragraph">
        
        <ul>
        <li>These can be in the laboratory or field</li>
        <li>Highly structured test </li>
        <li>Manipulates 1 variable (IV) while measuring its effect on another variable (DV) e.g. affect of changing an interface (IV) on the time (DV) it takes a person to undertake a task using the software.</li>
        <li>Very well established (used commonly in natural sciences)</li>
        <li>Able to collect very accurate, reproducible data. Usually times, test scores or something similar is collected as the DV. </li>
        
        </ul> 	
    </li>
    </div>
   
    <div class="content-header">Presentation of Quantitative Data:</div>
   <div class="content-paragraph">

        
        <ul>
        <li>This data is analysed using the appropriate statistical methods. You should design your data collection with your statistical method in mind to ensure you obtain a large enough sample of measurements to analyse. There are many statistical methods and you should seek advice as to which one is the most appropriate for your data. Results are commonly shown as pie charts, graphs tables, percentages to name a few.</li>
       </ul> 	

    </li>
    </div>
    <div class="content-header">Multiple Methods:</div>
   <div class="content-paragraph"> 
        
        <ul>
        <li>An approach that combines both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection and analyses. Also known as Mixed methods. Such an approach takes advantage of the strengths of  both quantitative and qualitative methods. If data from various sources are used, the process is often called triangulation.</li>
       </ul> 
       <ul>
       <li>Documenting the Research Method: <ul>
       <li>It is important to document your research method(s) in your deliverables. This should include:</li>
       <li>High level description of the method &amp; why it is sensible (compare briefly to other methods)</li>
       <li>Who was involved – how many? </li>
       <li>Venue/location</li>
       <li>Materials required to conduct the method </li>
       <li>Overall procedure</li>
       <li>Ethical considerations</li>
       </ul></li>
     
        </ul>
