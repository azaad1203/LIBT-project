          <li>Types of Question:
            <ul>
              <li>Open questions:
                <ul>
                  <li>The question is asked in such a manner that the respondent   can answer in any way he/she chooses. E.g.Describe the events that led   up to the cancellation of the XYZ project?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Closed questions:
                <ul>
                  <li>The question is asked in such a way that the respondent can only   choose from a selection of pre-determined answers,. E.g. How frequently   do you use the ABC information system?
                    <ul>
                      <li>More than once a week </li>
                      <li>2 to 3 times a month </li>
                      <li>Once a month </li>
                      <li>Once a week</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>

		  <div class="content-header">Advantages and Disadvantages of Open &amp; Closed Questions</div>
<div class="content-paragraph">           <ul>
            <li>Advantages of open questions:
              <ul>
                <li>Respondents can answer in their own terms - Not forced to answer in the terms provided by closed answers.</li>
                <li>Allow unusual responses to be derived - Replies that the   survey researcher may not have considered (and that would therefore not   form the basis for fixed-choice alternatives) are possible.</li>
                <li>Do not suggest certain kinds of answer to respondents -   Respondents' levels of knowledge and understanding of issues can be   tapped. The salience of issues for respondents can also be explored.   (for example: doctors/nurses/… and their responses)</li>
                <li>Useful for exploring new areas or ones in which the researcher   has limited knowledge - Exploratory and pilot studies to prepare later   fixed-choice format answers</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Disadvantages of open questions:
              <ul>
                <li>Time-consuming for interviewers to administer - Interviewees   are likely to talk for longer than is usually the case with a comparable   closed question.</li>
                <li>Answers have to be ‘coded‘ - Very time-consuming and ambiguous a problem of meaning</li>
                <li>Require greater effort from respondents - In case of a self-completion questionnaire, need to write for much longer.</li>
                <li>Possibility in structured interviews of variability between   interviewers in the recording of answers - Likely to arise as a result   of the difficulty of writing down verbatim what respondents say to   interviewers à problem of meaning</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Advantages of closed questions:
              <ul>
                <li>It is easy to process answers - Codes emerge naturally.</li>
                <li>Enhance the comparability of answers - Easier to show the   relationship between variables and to make comparisons between   respondents or types of respondents</li>
                <li>Clarify the meaning of a question for respondents - Choice of answers may help to clarify the meaning of the concept</li>
                <li>Easy for interviewers and/or respondents to complete - No need to write extensively</li>
                <li>In interviews, closed questions reduce the possibility of variability in the recording of answers</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Disadvantages of closed questions:
              <ul>
                <li>Loss of naturalness in answers - Respondent’s replies may not be covered by fixed answers provided</li>
                <li>There may be variation among respondents in the interpretation of forced-choice answers - The problem of meaning</li>
                <li>Closed questions may be irritating to respondents - Especially if they cannot find a category that they feel applies to them </li>
                <li>In interviews, a large number of closed questions may make it   difficult to establish rapport - The respondent and interviewer are less   likely to engage with each other in a conversation, giving the   interview an impersonal feel</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

     <ul>
                <li>An Interview is a special type of interaction between   individuals where the purpose is for the person(s) undertaking the   interview to obtain information from the other(s)</li>
                <li>An interview is usually guided by an agenda or protocol and is not a random conversation</li>
                <li>The interviewer generally asks the questions while the interviewee provides responses</li>
                <li>All information given in the interview is “on the record” and is assumed to be recorded in some manner</li>
                <li>When should we use Interviews?
                  <ul>
                    <li>To obtain detailed information </li>
                    <li>To ask complex, open-ended questions </li>
                    <li>To ask targeted, specific questions for different groups </li>
                    <li>To explore emotions, experiences, feelings not easily obtained otherwise </li>
                    <li>To investigate sensitive issues or informationTo obtain detailed information</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What kind of questions to ask in the interview:                
                  <ul>
                    <li>Introducing questions: `Please tell me about when your   interest in X first began?'; `Have you ever . . .?'; `Why did you go to .   . .?' . </li>
                    <li>Follow-up questions: getting the interviewee to elaborate   his/her answer, such as `Could you say some more about that?'; `What do   you mean by that . . .?'; ‘Can you give me an example…?’</li>
                    <li>Specifying questions: `What did you do then?'; `How did X react to what you said?’ </li>
                    <li>Direct questions: `Do you find it easy to keep smiling   when serving customers?'; `Are you happy with the amount of on-the-job   training you have received?' Such questions are perhaps best left until   towards the end of the interview, in order not to influence the   direction of the interview too much. </li>
                    <li>Probing questions: following up what has been said through direct questioning.</li>
                  </ul>

                <li>Interview pitfalls (DANGERS):

                    <li>Bias </li>
                    <li>Ambiguity of language </li>

                <ul>
                  <li>In general, a questionnaire is a research instrument consisting of a sequence of pre-determined questions in a specific order</li>
                  <li>The responses to the questions are used in further analysis and interpretation</li>
                  <li>Questionnaires form the basis of most cross-sectional research designs, e.g. the survey</li>
                  <li>Types of questionnaires:</li>
                  <li>Self-administered: the respondent answers the survey on their own e.g.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Postal surveys</li>
