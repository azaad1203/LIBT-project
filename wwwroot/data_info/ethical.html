<h1>Ethical and legal issues in data collection and management</h1>

<div class="content-header">What is ethical behaviour?</div>
<div class="content-paragraph">          
<ul>
<li>Output of the research method(s) (data &amp; analysis) will inform ‘designs’ (+ solution/project evaluations)<ul>
<li>Ethics – “a set of principles of right conduct or a theory or a system of moral values”</li>
<li>Doing the right thing according to standards set by society<ul>
<li>But whose society?</li>
<li>What is considered ethically sound in one culture may be unacceptable to another</li>
<li>Moral/ethical codes vary at all levels from social groups through organisations up to national levels</li>
<li>Professional behaviour needs to be guided by a moral code that defines clear boundaries to both individuals and organisations</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></div>

<div class="content-header">Ethical issues in IT (C, 13.1.1, C&amp;C, 9.3.1):</div>
<div class="content-paragraph">        
<ul>
<li>Organisations collect huge quantities of data pertaining to: <ul>	
<li>Employees</li>
<li>Customers/clients </li>
        </ul></li>

      <li>Tempting for organisations/managers to extract this data to gain competitive advantage      <ul>
      <li>Certain uses of business intelligence technologies can push ethical boundaries</li>
      <li>Tempting for employees to abuse their access privileges for personal gain</li>
      <li>From simple nosiness: “How much does my colleague/neighbour earn?&quot; to criminal acts e.g. identity theft</li>
	        <li>It is important that those entrusted with access to personal data ensure peoples’ privacy is maintained as far as possible. Data held is necessary, accurate and not held for any longer than it is practically needed</li>
      </ul></li>  </ul>	
      </div>
	<div class="content-header">Ethical vs. legal behaviour (C, 13.1.2):</div>
 <div class="content-paragraph">        
  <ul>
    <li>Society adopts laws to insist on ethical behaviour</li>
    <li>Q: Is all unethical behaviour illegal?
      <ul>
        <li>Lonely Joe works for a DVD rental company. He wants to ask   his neighbour on a date.  So, he has a quick look at her rental history   to gain conversation ideas. May not be strictly illegal but is   ethically questionable. Impossible to legislate against all possible   instances of wrongful behaviour. Also, the fast pace of technological   change means legislation often struggles to keep up with new problems.   Ethical codes of practice must fill the gap in the mean-time.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Is all ethical behaviour legal?
      <ul>
        <li>A behaviour may be arguably ethical but currently illegal.   Examples? Unfortunately the law is not flexible and must be adhered to   first and foremost</li>
        <li>A realistic example:
          <ul>
            <li>“Any research that involves human participation, the   collection or study of their data, organs and/or tissue, and that is   carried out on Brunel University premises and/or by Brunel University   staff or Brunel University students under the supervision of Brunel   University staff requires ethical approval.” (Brunel University research   ethics committee, 2005, p. 3). </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Particularly relevant for your final year project</li>
    <li>Need to conform to BCS code</li>
    <li>Also advise following guidelines from British Psychological Society (BPS, 2004). Specifically regarding:
      <ul>
        <li>Consent - ‘Whenever possible, the investigator should inform   all participants of the objectives of the investigation. The   investigator should inform the participants of all aspects of the   research or intervention that might reasonably be expected to influence   willingness to participate. The investigator should, normally, explain   all other aspects of the research or intervention about which the   participants enquire…’</li>
        <li>Withdrawal - ‘At the onset of the investigation investigators   should make plain to participants their right to withdraw from the   research at any time, irrespective of whether or not payment or other   inducement has been offered…’‘In the light of experience of the   investigation, or as a result of debriefing, the participant has the   right to withdraw retrospectively any consent given, and to require that   their own data, including recordings, be destroyed…’</li>
        <li>Confidentiality - ‘Subject to the requirements of legislation,   including the Data Protection Act, information obtained about a   participant during an investigation is confidential unless otherwise   agreed in advance…Participants…have a right to expect that information   they provide will be treated confidentially and, if published, will not   be identifiable as theirs…’</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

	<div class="content-header">Computer Crime and Abuse:</div>
	<div class="content-paragraph">  
	<ul>
           <li>Theft – particularly of data and software</li>
           <li>If you are focussing on cause and effect, for example, your research question is about:&quot; what is the effect of using unleaded petrol on air pollution issues?”, then quantitative method is useful.</li>
           </ul>
	</div>
	
<div class="content-header">Computer Crime and Abuse Part 2:</div>
	
	<div class="content-paragraph">     
    <ul>
  <li>Hacking – with the aim of causing system damage or data theft</li>
  <li>Spamming – unsolicited emailing; can disrupt or disable networks </li>
  <li>Sniffing – electronic eavesdropping; encryption vital to ensure security (e.g. HTTPS)</li>
<li>Identity theft: <ul>
    <li>Phishing (the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. They are fake (even though credible) requests for confidential data </li>
    <li>Skimming (credit card fraud)– details are stolen from magnetic strip or RF tag of a card</li>
    <li>Computer Misuse Act (1990) made it illegal to make unauthorised access or changes to computer material</li>
    <li>Computer Misuse Amendment Bill (2002) introduced to prohibit denial of service attacks (causing direct/indirect degradation or failure of a computer system) </li>
  </ul></li></ul>
 
    </div>

	<div class="content-header">Liability and accountability:</div>
	<div class="content-paragraph">  
    <ul>
      <li>Who's responsible?      
        <ul>
          <li>Traditionally public carriers (e.g. Royal Mail) were not liable   for the content they carry.	However, ISPs (Internet Service Provider)   are coming under increasing pressure to monitor the legality of the   content they host/transmit (e.g. pornography). Some are pressing for   ISPs to be liable for copyright violation simply by allowing the   transmission from one PC to another (i.e. P2P file sharing)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Privacy:
        <ul>
          <li>IT has significantly increased the capacity to store, transmit and analyse personal data </li>
          <li>Decreased storage costs has enabled organisations to maintain detailed databases on individuals </li>
          <li>Sophisticated data-mining techniques and powerful hardware allow   this data to be joined and processed in ways beyond that for which it   was collected </li>
          <li>Thanks to the Internet, data can be retrieved almost instantly   from any remote source this has led to a lucrative market in profiling   individuals </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Profile data is bought by businesses to increase their competitive   advantage (for example, unexpected phone calls from insurance agency,   financial agency, an so on).</li>
      <li>Negative implications for privacy:      
        <ul>
          <li>Data can be used for purposes other than that for which it was originally collected (and therefore approved) </li>
          <li>Data can be combined from different sources to build a profile of greater complexity than that originally envisaged </li>
          <li>Inaccurate data may be copied from one holder to another and   combined with other sources, with no recourse for correction (Chinese   whispers : passing info from one place to another) </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To counter this the UK introduced the Data Protection Acts (1994, 1998)      
        <ul>
          <li>The Data Protection Act (1998). 8 key principles (edited for briefness):
            <ul>
              <li>Personal data should be processed fairly and lawfully and only if necessary </li>
              <li>Personal data shall be obtained for one or more specified purposes, and not processed further for other purposes </li>
              <li>Personal data should be adequate, relevant and not excessive </li>
              <li>Personal data should be accurate and kept up to date </li>
              <li>Personal data should not be kept for longer than is necessary for the original purpose </li>
              <li>Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under this Act </li>
              <li>Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken   against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage of   personal data </li>
              <li>Personal data should not be transferred to a country outside of the   EU unless they ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights   and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal   data</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Implications of Data Protection Act (DPA):
        <ul>
          <li>Applies to data held:
            <ul>
              <li>On computers or in computer-readable format </li>
              <li>Manually (if in structured form) </li>
              <li>As medical and educational records</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Under 1994 Act, Data Subjects had the basic right to know what data was held about them</li>
      <li>New rights of data subjects under 1998 Act:      
        <ul>
          <li>To know nature of data held </li>
          <li>To know why and how it is to be processed </li>
          <li>To know to whom it may be disclosed </li>
          <li>To have copies of the data, subject to nominal fee (£10) </li>
          <li>To object to and prevent processing of data if damage/distress would be caused </li>
          <li>To claim compensation for damage caused by breach of the Act</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

 <div class="content-paragraph">       
      <ul>
        <li>Intellectual property (IP) is intangible property created by an individual or organisation</li>
        <li>Literary works, music, video, art, designs, inventions and trademarks</li>
        <li>Often a large amount of time, effort and funding is involved in the development of IP</li>
        <li>The producer needs to be protected from others profiting from their hard-work without their consent</li>
        <li>It is important to understand intellectual property rights so as to:</li>
        <li>Understand your personal and/or your organisations rights as and when original ideas and works are produced</li>
        <li>To recognise the value of original works</li>
        <li>To understand the procedures for protecting and exploiting IP</li>
        <li>To know what legal measures can be used to defend against breach of copyright and patent</li>
        <li>To be fair and sensible regarding legitimate use of your work for non-profit purposes</li>
        <li>There are two main kinds of protection:
          <ul>
            <li>Patent</li>
            <li>Copyright</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Patents:
          <ul>
            <li>A more powerful means of protecting IP</li>
            <li>The ideas should be original and not obvious</li>
            <li>Protects the idea behind an invention</li>
            <li>Patents  are published, thus benefiting public knowledge</li>
            <li>There are clear boundaries defining what can be patented</li>
            <li>Software is not (usually) patentable</li>
            <li>Artistic creations, mathematical models, plans, schemes or other purely mental processes cannot be patented</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Copyright:
          <ul>
            <li>Comes into effect automatically - protects the expression or demonstration of an idea </li>
            <li>Covers traditional documents like books, music articles, movies/TV </li>
            <li>Copyright (UK) normally extends beyond the author' s lifetime. Some exceptions:</li>
            <li>Sound records and broadcasts – 50 years</li>
            <li>Published editions (typographical arrangement) – 25 years</li>
            <li>Authors may license others to produce copies, often in return for 'royalties'</li>
            <li>Copyright can be transferred (for e.g. to employer or publisher)</li>
            <li>Whilst software is automatically copyright, this does not   prevent others from writing their own code to implement the same ideas   (reverse engineering – developing a new device from a set of devices,   objects…). <span>So, copyright does not protect ideas.</span></li>
          </ul>

      </ul>

     <div class="content-header">Issues for software:</div>
 <div class="content-paragraph">   
        <ul>
          <li>Patentability:
            <ul>
              <li>Generally accepted principle that software should be protected by   copyright (i.e. only the product/implementation, not the core idea).</li>
              <li>Grey area: sometimes software can be patented if it is an integral part of some overall machine or system.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Copyright:
            <ul>
              <li>Applies to all software, free or commercial.</li>
              <li>Software will have a license defining terms of use and distribution.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>IPR issues for software:
            <ul>
              <li>Four main types of license:
                <ul>
                  <li>Commercial (continuous use) </li>
                  <li>One-off fee</li>
                  <li>One machine only (unless otherwise stated) but can make back-ups</li>
                  <li>Commercial (annual fee):
                    <ul>
                      <li>License key issued annually by supplier (for example, antivirus software)</li>
                      <li>Often applies to site licenses (e.g. SPSS)</li>
                      <li>Shareware:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Free trial period</li>

                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Freeware:

                          <li>Compiled vs. open-source</li>
                          <li>Open source allows anyone to modify the code, and  any improvements are submitted to the author</li>
                          <li>Still subject to terms and conditions (e.g. GNU public license) and so copyright applies</li>
                          <li>May only be free for certain categories of use (e.g. Non-profit, academic</li>
